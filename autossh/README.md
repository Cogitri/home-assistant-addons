# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Autossh

## About

Use SSH to make ports of your local Home Assistant setup available at a remote system.
This forms yet another way to make services on your local system (e.g. the Lovelace UI) accessible from the public internet.
If you do not have the authority to open ports into your local network, and a VPN solutions seems overkill, this add-on might just be the solution for you.

This add-on is only useful to those with access to a publicly available SSH server and some administrative privileges on that system.

Autossh is a well known tool to establish an SSH connection and keep it connected over hours and months.
SSH is known for its high security and the ability to set up port forwardings in both directions through the SSH connection.
In combination, this add-on offers tunneled port forwarding functionality.

Configuration steps **needed**. Check documentation for further details.
